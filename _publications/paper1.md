abstract: "The recent progress in autonomous driving
primarily relies on sensor-rich systems, encompassing radars,
LiDARs, and advanced cameras, in order to perceive the
environment. However, human-operated vehicles showcase an
impressive ability to drive based solely on visual perception.
This study introduces an end-to-end method for predicting the
steering angle and vehicle speed exclusively from a monocular
camera image. Alongside the color image, which conveys scene
texture and appearance details, a monocular depth image
and a semantic segmentation image are internally derived
and incorporated, offering insights into spatial and semantic
environmental structures. This results in a total of three
input images. Moreover, LSTM units are also employed to
acquire temporal features. The proposed model demonstrates
a significant enhancement in RMSE compared to the state-ofthe-
art, achieving a notable improvement of 44.96% for the
steering angle and 4.39% for the speed on the Udacity dataset.
Furthermore, tests on the CARLA and Sully Chen datasets yield
results that outperform those reported in the literature. Extensive
ablation studies are also conducted to showcase the effectiveness
of each component. These findings highlight the potential of selfdriving
systems using visual input alone."
